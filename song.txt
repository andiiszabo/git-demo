Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi
See me ride out of the sunset
On your colour TV screen
Out for all that I can get
If you know what I mean
Women to the left of me
And women to the right
Ain't got no gun
Ain't got no knife
Don't you start no fight
'Cause I'm
(T.N.T.) I'm dynamite
(T.N.T.) And I'll win the fight
(T.N.T.) I'm a power load
(T.N.T.) Watch me explode
